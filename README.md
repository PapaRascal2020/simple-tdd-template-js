# A simple enviroment for Javascript TDD 

A simple skeleton project to test Javascript.

Uses: Jasmine Spec Runner

## To use

* Download/Clone the repository
* Open root folder and open SpecRunner.html

I have included a simple math test just to show its working.
This is what I use for my Javascript TDD.

## Create your own tests. 

Although naming is up to you I use {functionname}Spec.js and {functionname}.js
You create the Spec (test) file in the spec folder and the function file in the src folder.

To refrence place the JS in the SpecRunner.html in the same way as the sample scripts are included.

To see your tests just refresh SpecRunner.html.

## Jasmine Spec Runner
